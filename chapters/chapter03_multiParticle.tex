\chapter{Study of Particle Multiplicity of Cosmic Ray Events using
  2\,m\,$\times$\,2\,m Resistive Plate Chamber Stack at IICHEP-Madurai}
\label{chapter:multi}

One of the main goals of the INO Project is to collaborate with Indian
Industries in order to streamline the production and the procurement
of various components as well as the RPC detectors. Transfer of
technologies and experiences in between industries and research teams
is the key aspect of this effort.
An experimental setup consisting of 12 layers of glass Resistive Plate
Chambers (RPCs) of size 2\,m\,$\times$\,2\,m has been built at
IICHEP-Madurai (\ang{9;56;14.5}\,N \ang{78;00;47.9}\,E, on the surface)
to study the long term performance and stability of RPCs produced on
large scale in Indian industry. This setup has been collecting data
triggered by the passage of charged particles. The data is analysed
to understand the behaviour of the RPCs as well as the electronics
used to run and collect data from the setup. The data is also utilised
to gain knowledge of the cosmic ray muons reaching the surface of
the earth. The measurement of the multiplicity of charged particles due to
cosmic ray interactions are presented here. The results are compared
with different hadronic models of the CORSIKA simulation. The data
collected near magnetic equator gives us vital information regarding
the capabilities of the simulation packages. As the current
experimental setup is located within 81\,km from INO-Site, in depth
analysis of this data also improves the prediction power of
the Monte-Carlo simulations for this project.

\section{Cosmic showers at the earth surface}

The upper atmosphere of the earth gets a large dosage of exposure of
high energy primary cosmic rays originating in outer space. These
primary cosmic rays consist of mostly protons with a smaller fraction
of higher \mbox{Z-Nuclei} elements\cite{cosmic1}. The angular
distributions of the primary cosmic rays are more or less isotropic
at the top of the atmosphere. The energy spectra of the primary
cosmic rays follow the power-law spectrum, $dN/dE \propto E^{-\gamma}$,
where power-law parameter, $\gamma \sim $ 2.7. The shower of secondary
particles consisting mainly of
\mbox{pions $\left(\pi^{\pm}/\pi^0\right)$} and
\mbox{kaons $\left(K^{\pm}\right)$} which are produced due the
interactions of primary cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei.
The neutral pions mainly decay via electro-magnetic interactions,
$\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma+\gamma$ whereas the charged pions decay to
muons and neutrinos via weak-interactions,
$\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_{\mu}$ and
$\pi^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$. The kaons also decay to
muons, neutrinos and to pions in different branching fractions.
Most of the pions and kaons decay in flight and do not reach the
earth's surface.
 A small fraction of resultant muons decay into
electrons and neutrinos, 
$\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_{e} + \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ and 
$\mu^- \rightarrow e^- + \bar{\nu}_{e} + \nu_{\mu}$. 
The $\gamma$, $e^{\pm}$ do not reach the detector directly as they
interact with the roof of the laboratory and generate electromagnetic
showers.
Thus, muons are the
most abundant charged particle from cosmic ray showers detected in the
present setup. These atmospheric muons are produced at high altitude
(average height of 20\,km) in the atmosphere and lose almost 2\,GeV
energy via ionisation loss in the air before reaching the ground. The 
density of charged particles (mainly muons) per unit surface area at
the earth's surface depends on the composition of primary cosmic ray,
power-law parameter ($\gamma$) as well as the model of hadronic
interactions at high energy which is not accessible in the laboratory.

The principal aim of this work is to observe the charged-particle
multiplicity in the atmospheric muon data collected
at IICHEP, Madurai and compared it with the air shower simulation.

In this study, the detector setup has been described in
the Section~\ref{sec:detectorA}. The Monte-Carlo simulation techniques
used to study the multiplicity has been explained in
Section~\ref{sec:montecarlo}, where primary cosmic ray interactions
are simulated using the CORSIKA Package\cite{corsika763} and
interactions of the particle with detector material are simulated
using the GEANT4 toolkit\cite{geant4}.


\section{Detector Setup} \label{sec:detectorA}
The RPC stack operational at IICHEP, Madurai consisting of 12 RPCs
stacked horizontally with an inter-layer gap of 16\,cm is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:stack} where the $X$-axis of the detector is making an
angle of $-10^\circ$ with the geographic south.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{ABlockStackiDAQ_new.jpg} 
  \caption{The detector stack with 12 layers of RPCs where the
    $X$-axis of the detector is making an angle of $-10^\circ$ with
    the geographic south, (left) experimental setup and (right) Geant4
    detector geometry of stack.}
  \label{fig:stack}
\end{figure}
An RPC gap is made of two glass electrodes of thickness 3\,mm with
a gap of 2\,mm between them. Uniform gap between these two electrodes
is maintained using an array of 2\,mm thick poly-carbonate buttons.
The glass gap is sealed on the outer edges to make it air-tight.
A non-flammable mixture of gas is continuously
flown inside the glass gaps via strategically placed nozzles.
This mixture of gasses serves as the active medium of the detector.
The RPCs are operated in avalanche mode. In this case, the mixture of
gases consists of R134a (95.2\%), iso-C$_4$H$_{10}$ (4.2\%) and
SF$_6$ (0.3\%). Both the outer surfaces of the glass gap are coated
with a thin layer of graphite. The RPCs are operated by applying
a differential supply of $\pm$\,5\,kV to the graphite layers to
achieve the desired electric field. The target gas inside the RPCs get
ionised by the transit of charged particles. This ionisation eventually
evolves into an avalanche in the presence of the high electric field
between the glass electrodes. The avalanche in the RPCs induces
signals in the two orthogonal pickup panels placed on both sides of
the glass gaps labelled as X-side and Y-side. The pickup
panels are made of parallel copper strips of width 28\,mm with 2\,mm
gap between two consecutive strips. The RPCs used in this detector
stack are of the size of 1790\,mm\,$\times$\,1890\,mm. There are
60 strips on the X side and 63 strips on the Y side for each layer.

The induced signals from the pickup strips are amplified and
discriminated by a charge sensitive NINO\cite{nino} front-end
amplifier-discriminator board. Only in layer 11 (topmost layer),
ANUSPARSH front-end ASIC\cite{anusp} which is a CMOS, 8-channel,
high speed, low power amplifier-discriminator designed for
avalanche mode of operation for RPCs is used to study its performance.
The discriminated signals from these front-end boards are passed
to the FPGA-based RPCDAQ-board. The individual signals from every 
8$^{th}$ strips are \emph{OR}ed to get pre-trigger signals (S0 to S7).
The 1-fold (S0+S1+...S7), 2-fold (S0.S1+S1.S2+..S6.S7),
3-fold (S0.S1.S2+....S5.S6.S7) and 4-fold
(S0.S1.S2.S3+....S4.S5.S6.S7) signals created by RPCDAQ are passed
to the Trigger system module via Signal Router Board. The Global
Trigger is generated by Global Trigger Logic Board based (GTLB)
on X- or Y-plane with at least one strip hit within
100\,ns coincidence window. The coincidence is done for X and Y plane
independently and the final trigger can be generated by GTLB by OR
of Trigger in X- or Y-plane. The higher order trigger configurations
are useful where neutral-current interaction are expected within the
detector generating tracks with shorter tracks but higher multiplicity.
However only 1-fold signal is used to generate the trigger in the
current study as we are expecting only muon-events in the detector
which creates longer tracks. The event signals in the RPCDAQ board
stretched to 1\,$\mu$s to overcome trigger latency of 770\,ns from
Trigger System to RPCDAQ. Based on the arrival of trigger signals to
RPCDAQ, the event signals are latched and sent to the Data Concentrator
and Event Builder via Network Switch. The trigger system's `dead-time'
is set at 500\,ns after generation of a trigger to process and store
the triggered event.
The flow of signals from the RPCs to the Back-End is shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:sigflow}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{DAQSchemeNewElectronics.pdf} 
  \caption{Signal flow from RPC to Back-End.}
  \label{fig:sigflow}
\end{figure}
The detailed description of signal processing and the Data Acquisition
system (DAQ) can be found in \cite{elec1}. The 1-Fold signals
from layers 4, 5, 6 and 7 are used as trigger to record the cosmic
events used in the present work.

Although the coincidence window is 100\,ns, the signals for any other
particles as well as noise in a time period of -230\,ns to 770\,ns
after generation of the trigger are also may get recorded due to
stretching of the hit signal and trigger latency. A generalised timing
diagram of an event which includes the hits from two particles is
shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:timingdiagram}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{TimingDiagram-TimeSimple.pdf} 
  \caption{Timing diagram of an event.}
  \label{fig:timingdiagram}
\end{figure}
If the particle which is generating trigger has passed through the
detector at time $t_{1}$, then all other signals within the period of
$t_{1}$ to $t_{1}+770$\,ns also get recorded due to the trigger latency
of 770\,ns. The signals generated within the time period
$t_{1}-230$\,ns to $t_{1}$\ are also get recorded as well but only in
the following situations.
\vspace*{-10pt}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -5pt
\item \textbf{Case~1:} The hits generated by the other particle did
  not satisfy the trigger criteria.
\item \textbf{Case~2:} The hits generated by the other particle
  satisfied the trigger criteria, but failed to generate a trigger
  as it occurred within the `dead-time' of the trigger system.
\item \textbf{Case~3:} The hits generated by any of the particles in
  the event did not satisfy the trigger criteria individually.
  The hits generated by the earlier particle satisfied the trigger
  criteria partially (say, for layers 4 \& 5). The hits generated by
  the latest particle occurring within the trigger window of 100\,ns
  satisfied the rest of the trigger criteria (say, for layers 6 \& 7)
  and generated the trigger.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{-10pt}
%% The number of coincidences for the case 2 and 3 are very less compared
%% to the case 1.

An event typically contains hit information (one logic bit per strip
indicating the signal in that strip) for each strip and 16 time
signals for each layer; 8 for X-side and other 8 for Y-side.
One TDC channel records time signals coming from every alternating
8$^{th}$ strips (S0 to S7).
The cosmic events recorded in the detector for the total observation
period between August 23, 2017 to September 8, 2017 with a trigger
rate of $\sim$230\,Hz are used for the analysis.


\section{Monte-Carlo Simulation} \label{sec:montecarlo}
The Monte-Carlo Simulation for this study has been executed in
two stages. The Extensive Air Shower (EAS) has been simulated
by the CORSIKA simulation package\cite{corsika763}. The information
of daughter particles generated by the EAS at the earth's surface
level has been extracted and used as the input data to the detector
simulation. The detector simulation has been executed with the help
of the GEANT4 toolkit\cite{geant4}.

\subsection{Extensive Air Shower}
The CORSIKA (COsmic Ray SImulations for KAscade) is developed to study
the evolution of the EAS in the atmosphere created by primary cosmic
ray. Though the CORSIKA has been developed initially for a specific
experiment, this package is now developed into a tool that is used
by many groups studying cosmic rays and EAS.
In the current study, existing extrapolations of hadronic interaction
models of high energy particles in the EAS are based on
various theoretical models, which have large uncertainties.
The current experimental data at the collider experiments is
insufficient to verify the extrapolation of the hadronic interactions
at very high energies. In the CORSIKA package, the several different
hadronic interaction models are available. In this study, for
simulating the behaviour of hadrons for higher energy range,
the QGSJET (Quark Gluon String model with JETs)\cite{corsika763} has
been adopted and for the low energy range (less than 80\,GeV in
laboratory frame), the GHEISHA model has been used.

In this study, the primary cosmic ray shower has been simulated using
the CORSIKA(v7.6300) Package. The energy of the primary rays in the
CORSIKA is generated using the power-law spectrum, $E^{-2.7}$, within
the energy range of \mbox{$10$--$10^{6}$\,GeV} for different primaries
(H, He, C, O, Si and Fe). The zenith and azimuth angle of the primary
cosmic particles are generated uniformly within the range of
\mbox{$0$--$85^\circ$} and \mbox{$0$--$360^\circ$}, respectively. The
rigidity cutoff due to the earth's magnetic field has been implemented
as per the location of the detector. The minimum energy cutoffs for
secondary hadrons, muons, electrons and photons in the simulation are
kept at 50\,MeV, 10\,MeV, 1\,MeV and 1\,MeV, respectively. These cutoff
values are much smaller than the minimum momentum cutoff for
the charged particles in the vertical direction,
\mbox{$\sim 110$\,MeV}, which is mainly due to 22\,cm of concrete
roof of the building where the detector is placed. The momentum
spectra of secondary charged particles generated by the CORSIKA
simulation is shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:momin}.
%GMA four plots ofr all those particles with lower range 1 MeV

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{momin_reco_1.pdf} 
  \caption{CORSIKA generated momentum of charged particle at observation level.}
  \label{fig:momin}
\end{figure}

The secondary particles generated by the CORSIKA which are reaching
the observation surface are provided as an input to the detector
simulation. The observation plane has been divided
into squares of the size of 2\,m\,$\times$\,2\,m which is shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:eas}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{EAS.pdf} 
  \caption{Shower of particles initiated by primary cosmic ray
    reaching observation surface.}
  \label{fig:eas}
\end{figure}
An event is formed using the information of the particle(s) reaching
to each of these squares shown as shaded region in the
Figure~\ref{fig:eas}.


\subsection{Detector Simulation}
The detector simulation has been accomplished using the
GEANT4(v4-10.0.2) toolkit. The events generated in the CORSIKA
simulation are propagated event-by-event in the detector simulation.
A realistic depiction of the detector setup including the building
where the detector is housed has been constructed in the GEANT4
environment. The materials of the various detector components and
the laboratory buildings are chosen based on the knowledge of the
setup. The uncertainty of the material budget is taken as a systematic
error. The physics processes of matter-particle interactions 
%GMA explicitly mention which models are used for Hadronic and EM interactions
like electromagnetic, ionisation, decay and hadronic interactions,
which are available within the GEANT4 toolkit are considered in the
simulation.

The various detector's parameters (efficiency, noise, strip
multiplicity and resolution) are calculated using the cosmic ray data.
The efficiency of a RPC gaps is defined as the probability of getting
a signal from a RPC when a particle has passed through it. The noise
in a RPC is defined as the hits occurred farther from the expected
position of the passing particle. The strip multiplicity profile is
defined as the probability of sharing signal between neighbouring
strips with respect to the hit position from the centre of the strip.
The strip multiplicity is discussed in the next section.
A detailed study of these parameters are presented in \cite{pethu1}.
The efficiency map, noise and strip multiplicity
profile for one of the RPCs in the stack is shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:layer2y}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{layer2properties.pdf} 
  \caption{(a) Efficiency, (b) Noise and (c) Multiplicity profile of
    Y side of Layer-2 RPC gap.}
  \label{fig:layer2y}
\end{figure}
These observed detector parameters are included in the digitisation
stage of the detector simulation. Both the events from the observed
cosmic ray data and the detector simulation are reconstructed using
an algorithm based on Hough Transformation which is discussed in the
next section.

\section{Event Reconstruction and Data Selection}\label{sec:reconstrction}
In the first step of the event reconstruction, the strip hits are analysed
independently, in the 2-dimensional projections namely,
\mbox{X--Z} and \mbox{Y--Z} sides. During the passage of a charged
particle through a RPC gap, the number of strips on which signal is
induced depends on the gain of the gas gap. This sharing of the induced
signal between the neighbouring strips is the main reason for the
observed strip multiplicity shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:layer2y}(c).
In order to prepare the events for this study, the consecutive strips
which have recorded signals are clubbed together to form a cluster.
During the study, the position resolution is calculated for different
strip multiplicities of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the values observed are
$\sim$6\,mm, $\sim$8\,mm, $\sim$12\,mm and $\sim$22\,mm respectively.
The position resolutions for strip multiplicities more than four is
larger than the pitch of the strip (3\,cm). So in this study,
the clusters of hits with more than 4 multiplicities are neglected
as the position resolution for higher multiplicities is found to be
the worse.
A layer which has more than 15 strip hits and/or more than 10 clusters
is tagged as `noisy layer' and not considered in the track
reconstruction. The first criterion has been chosen near the maximum
number of possible hits if 4 tracks pass through a RPC.
In fact, the maximum number of tracks reconstructed in an event is 4
which is discussed in the Result section. The second cut is set at
the first cut divided by the average strip multiplicity
$\left(\sim 1.5\right)$ in the detector stack to reject noisy events
passed through the first cut.
An event which has more than 3 noisy layers is considered as `noisy
event' and discarded. This cut is set at 3 layers which is 25\% of
maximum layers available for the event reconstruction. This cut has
been set by balancing the performance of the reconstruction method
and number of events lost due to this cut.

In the first step of track reconstruction, the clusters associated
with different tracks are found and grouped using the method of Hough
Transformation\cite{hought}. The equation of the straight line,
used to find the association between the hits, is given as,
\begin{equation}
  r=z\cos\theta+x\left(/y\right)\sin\theta. \label{eq:hough}
\end{equation}
The \mbox{$r$-$\theta$} plane (also called as Hough Space) is
populated using the concept of Cellular Automaton\cite{cellular}.
For a sample event shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:houghPl}(a),
the populated \mbox{$r$-$\theta$} plane is presented in the
Figure~\ref{fig:houghPl}(b).
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{hough_Plane.pdf} 
  \caption{(a) Projection of an event in the detector and
    (b) populated $r$-$\theta$~plane using this event.}
  \label{fig:houghPl}
\end{figure}
The advantage of using Cellular Automaton technique is the significant
reduction of computation time to find a trajectory in the event.
This method can detect all the tracks avoiding the noise hits as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:houghPl}(a).

The tracks are identified using the Hough Transformation are then
fitted by a straight line given by the equation,
\begin{equation}
  x\left(/y\right)=mz+c \label{eq:plain}
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $c$ are the slope and the intersect, respectively.
The number of detector layers in the fit and $\chi^{2}$/ndf of
the fit are shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:chi2ndf}(a) and
\ref{fig:chi2ndf}(b) respectively.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{chi2ndf_compare_all.pdf} 
  \caption{(a) Number of hit layer and
    (b) $\chi^2$/ndf of straight line fit.}
  \label{fig:chi2ndf}
\end{figure}
A track is considered as properly reconstructed if the $\chi^{2}$/ndf
is less than 10 and there are more than 4 layers in the track.
The reconstruction efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number
of events with at-least one reconstructed track to the total number
of triggered events. The reconstruction efficiency as a function of 
time is shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:stackineffi}.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{stack_ineffi_1.pdf} 
  \caption{Variation of reconstruction efficiency of the detector
    with time.}
  \label{fig:stackineffi}
\end{figure}
It can be observed that the reconstruction efficiency varies
periodically with time which is correlated to the variation
of the ambient pressure and temperature due to the solar
atmospheric tides \cite{rpcleak}. But this periodic change in 
the reconstruction efficiency does not affect the relative ratio of
the multiple track events. The pure multiple track events are
$\sim$0.01\% of triggered events. Out of the total triggered events,
also 6--7\,\% of events are due to noises and hadronic showers
initiated at the roof.
An extreme shower event (which can also be due to the noise) shown
in the Figure~\ref{fig:eshower} can also imitate a multi-track event.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Multi_Event_20170823_102605_3088_Shower_1.pdf} 
 \caption{Example of an extreme shower event.}
 \label{fig:eshower}
\end{figure}
Any such ambiguous events are rejected by the selection criteria
used in the study discussed in the following.

The zenith and azimuth angle distributions of the reconstructed
tracks are presented in the Figure \ref{fig:thetaphi}(a) and
\ref{fig:thetaphi}(b), respectively.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{thetaphi_compare_all.pdf} 
  \caption{(a) Zenith and (b) Azimuth Angle of cosmic rays
    reaching the detector 
stack.}
  \label{fig:thetaphi}
\end{figure}
The projections from both the X--Z and Y--Z planes are combined
to produce the final 3-dimensional track(s). Any ghost tracks formed
while combining are discarded by using the timing information recorded
for each strip. The events of interest for this study are the
events with more than one reconstructed 3-dimensional track.
The distribution of the time separation between each pair of
reconstructed tracks for both the simulation and data are shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:time_sep}(a).
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{time_diff_compare_all.pdf} 
  \caption{Time separation of two tracks for (a) all events and
    (b) for events with only parallel tracks.}
  \label{fig:time_sep}
\end{figure}
In the case of data, it can be observed that there is a significant
number of events where multiple particles are reaching the detector
with large relative time delay. The random coincidence of particles
originating in the different cosmic showers is the cause for these
events. The random coincidence of particles from different cosmic
showers are absent in the simulation as only one shower is simulated
at a time in the CORSIKA.
%% So the following procedure is adopted to
%% reject the random coincidences from the events which have been
%% initiated at the same showers.

In the simulation, it is observed that the particles originating
from the same shower are detected in the RPC stack as the parallel
tracks. This can be verified by calculating the skewed angle between
the each pair of tracks reconstructed in an event. The value of
skewed angle is ideally supposed to be zero in case of the parallel
tracks, but due to the finite size of the strip width and multiple
scattering it has finite width and tails. The distribution of the
skewed angle between the each pair of tracks reconstructed from
both the simulation and data is shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:skewed_angle}(a).
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{skewed_compare_reso_2plot_full.pdf}
  \caption{(a) Skewed angle between two tracks originating
    outside of the detector, (b) Skewed angle difference
    between generated and reconstructed tracks fitted with
    triple-Gaussian function.}
  \label{fig:skewed_angle}
\end{figure}
Now, only the parallel tracks are of the importance in this study
because of their same origin. In order to define the parallel tracks
reconstructed in this detector setup, good understanding about the
resolution of the skewed angle is necessary. To understand the
application of the skewed angle, events with multiple particles are
simulated in the GEANT4. The skewed angle $\left(s_{gen}\right)$
between generated pair of tracks in an event is calculated using
their generated directions. The skewed angle $\left(s_{reco}\right)$
between the same pair of tracks is estimated from the track
reconstruction also. The distribution of the sine of the difference
of the skewed angle between the generated particles and the skewed
angle between the reconstructed tracks, defined as the
$\sin\left(s_{gen}-s_{reco}\right)$, is shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:skewed_angle}(b). This distribution is fitted with
the triple-Gaussian function. The three components of these angular
resolutions ($\sigma_{0}$, $\sigma_{1}$, $\sigma_{2}$) represent the
cases, where (0) no multiple scattering happened for the pair of
tracks, (1) one of the tracks has gone through multiple scattering and
(2) both the tracks have gone through multiple scatterings in the
detector medium or in the roof of the housing building, respectively.

Based on these observations, a pair of tracks with a skewed angle less
than $2.5^{\circ} \left(\approx 3\sigma_{0}\right)$ are considered as
parallel to each other. All the pairs of tracks present in a
reconstructed event have to comply with this selection criteria.
Thus, in the current study, only the parallel tracks are considered
to select the events generated due to the particles originating from
the same cosmic ray shower. The time difference between a pair of
tracks for both the simulated and observed data after the criteria of
parallel track selection is shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:time_sep}(b).
It can be observed that the events from the random coincidences
disappear after rejecting the events with non-parallel tracks.

The particles, originated in the interaction of the secondary particles
with the detector medium or the roof are also not parallel to the
interacting particles as shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:eventinside}.
This skewed angle cut rejects these events as well.

\section{Results} \label{sec:result}
In the present work, the event direction is presumed
as a mean direction of all
individual tracks in an event. In the study, the clustering
of events towards any specific point in the sky was not observed
for the data recorded in the detector. Also, no significant
modulation of the fractions of multiple track events was observed
during the period of observation irrespective of periodic changes
in trigger rate. 
Hence, the assumption of the uniform distribution of the cosmic ray
directions which is used in the CORSIKA simulations is justified
by the absence of anisotropy in the data.

The normalised fraction of the events containing 2, 3 and 4 tracks
with respect to single track events are calculated to be
$6.35\pm 0.05\times 10^{-5}$, $5.82\pm 0.53\times 10^{-7}$ and
$1.94\pm 0.97\times 10^{-8}$, respectively from the cosmic ray data.

The normalised fraction of the events containing 2, 3 and 4 tracks
are also calculated from the CORSIKA simulation for different types
of cosmic primaries (H, He, C, O, Si, and Fe) and for different
hadronic interaction models (QGSJET-II-04 and QGSJET01d), which are
shown in the Table~\ref{tab:ratio1}. In order to compare the simulated
results with data, all the normalised fraction, calculated for
different cosmic primaries are summed with weights where the
abundances in the primary composition\cite{cosmic1,pdgspectra1} are
used as the weights. The
comparison of the data and the combined predictions are given in
the Table~\ref{tab:ratio2}.

If the abundances of elements in the primary cosmic ray spectrum as
observed in \cite{cosmic1,pdgspectra1} are used to estimate the final
results from simulation, the normalised track fractions of the events
containing 2, 3 and 4 tracks are order of magnitude less than
the data. The systematic error due to the uncertainties of roof
thickness, material in the detector setup, strip multiplicity, noise
and efficiencies are much smaller than the observed discrepancy
between data and MC prediction. These results clearly demonstrate
that there is a large discrepancy between the observed data and 
predictions from cosmic ray particle spectrum, the CORSIKA and
finally the GEANT4 simulation.

A few other experiments (KGF\cite{kgf1}, ALICE\cite{alice1},
MACRO\cite{macro1}, DELPHI\cite{delphi1}, ALEPH\cite{aleph1},
KASCADE-Grande\cite{kascade1}, etc.) have also studied the multi-muon
tracks in the cosmic events in the respective detectors. Except for
the KASCADE-Grande, all other experiments were performed under
the ground. The underground experiments have observed events with
large multiplicities because of the large size of the detectors and
the overburden of rock and soil, which block showers with low energy.
The multiplicity of the cosmic ray particles observed in a detector
is highly dependent on the dimensions, aperture, energy threshold
and detector's location. Hence, it is difficult to compare the
results of the aforesaid experiments quantitatively with the
small-scale detectors setup in this current study. But all
the studies based on the aforesaid experiments have also indicated
a similar discrepancy between the CORSIKA spectra and the observed
data. The KASCADE-Grande experiment has also concluded that the
attenuation length of muons in the atmosphere from the simulation
is much smaller than estimation from the observed data\cite{kascade1}.

The key limitation of the EAS simulation programs is the extrapolation
of the hadronic interactions in the high energy range which is not
verifiable by the experimental data. The limitation of the experiments
to measure the hadronic interactions at this high energy is mainly
due to limitation of the design of high energy $p\bar{p}$-colliders.
In the present $p\bar{p}$-colliders, the forward direction is not
accessible to the readout mechanism. The secondary particles
which are of the higher importance in the development of EAS
programs are undetected in the beam pipe of the colliders.
The largest energy fraction of each $p\bar{p}$-collision is
carried away by these particles. The maximum attainable energy
in these colliders is much lower than those found in cosmic rays.
Therefore, the extrapolations based on the theoretical models
are mainly used by all the EAS programs.

\section{Chapter Summary}
An experimental setup consisting of 12 layers of glass RPCs of the size
of 2\,m\,$\times$\,2\,m has been built at IICHEP-Madurai. The cosmic
ray data recorded by this detector setup is used to analysis the
secondary cosmic rays reaching the surface of the earth. In this
current study, we probed the multiplicity of the particles passing
through the detector. The recorded data is compared with the
Monte-Carlo simulations.
In the period between August 23, 2017 to September 8, 2017,
approximately two hundred million cosmic ray events were recorded.
As it is shown above, the analysis showed a large discrepancy in the
result predicted by the EAS simulation program which can be observed
in the comparison of the track multiplicity between the data and
Monte-Carlo. The results of the current study reflect that the current
physics models of interactions at the earth's atmosphere are unable to
reproduce the air showers accurately. The earlier measurements of the
muon multiplicity along with the present result can be used to
improve the parameters of the hadronic models at the high energies
and/or the cosmic ray spectral index.
